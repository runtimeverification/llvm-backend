# We build two libraries from the same source code here so that we can use the
# KLLVM bindings in two different contexts:
#   * Before a definition is kompiled, we'd still like to be able to manipulate
#     KORE ASTs using the LLVM data structures, even though we can't actually
#     execute them yet without the code-generated components.
#   * Once a definition is available, we want to be able to generate runtime
#     structures from an AST and take rewrite steps on that structure.
#
# The static library is designed to be linked with a generated interpreter by
# llvm-kompile to produce a shared library that Python can dynamically load.
