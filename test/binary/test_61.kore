// RUN: %strip-binary -i %test-input -k -o %t.out
// RUN: diff %t.out %test-diff-out

// This test is for the case where the binary is big enough so the stripped
// output needs to be flushed beforw renaming it. Previously, this was
// implicitly done by the std::fwrite call in the fdopen case, but not in the
// fopen case. This test ensures that the behaviour is consistent between the
// two cases.
